# Temperature Converter

Hey there! This is a simple little command-line tool I wrote in Rust to convert temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## How to run it

1.  Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine.
2.  Clone this repository.
3.  Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## What it does

Once you run the program, it will greet you with a menu where you can choose which conversion you'd like to do:

*   Celsius to Fahrenheit
*   Fahrenheit to Celsius

Just follow the on-screen prompts, and it will do the math for you.

Enjoy!
